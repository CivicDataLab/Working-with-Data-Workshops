1. This is not an introduction to Statistics
2. No, we'll not learn AI and ML
3. We will not learn about using the Microsoft Excel Analytics ToolPak addin
4. We will not use any additional analytical tools like Stata or SPSS to analyse data

---

# What .bg-green[we will cover] instead

1. In what ways can analysis of legal data help us
2. Common challenges with any data analysis project
3. Asking the right questions 
4. Data Analysis use cases

  6. FBI Crime Data Explorer
  7. Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)
5. How can we analyse the data in an un-biased way
6. The methodology matrix - What to use when

---

# Analysing legal data can help us in

1. Understanding how the judiciary functions
2. Creating more accountable institutions
3. Analysing the structural capacity of justice system across the country
4. Designing evidence-based judicial reforms
5. Designing better court/case management practices

# But there are hurdles to cross

## Challenges associated with most data driven engagements that can lessen the intended impact:

1. Availability of granular datasets
2. Bias in data collection and analysis
3. Beneficiaries not in alignment with the proposed outcomes
4. Setting up a multidisciplinary team that: 
  1. Understands the context
  2. Has the right set of skills to analyse data
  3. Can publish with purpose
5. Ethical use of datasets
6. Sustainability
7. Periodic data updates

and the list continues as well ..

# Biases in data analysis

.bg-washed-red.b--dark-red.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Confirmation bias** is the tendency to seek out or interpret data to confirm beliefs you already hold. It does this to the exclusion of contrary evidence.
]

--

.bg-washed-red.b--dark-red.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Selection Bias** is when the group chosen to be analyzed is not representative of the population you are trying to draw conclusions about.
]

--

.bg-washed-red.b--dark-red.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
**Survivorship bias** is the tendency to draw conclusions based on things that have survived, some selection process, and to ignore things that did not survive.]

## A story from WW2

![](assets/survivorship-bias.png)

---

## How to avoid bias

1. Better documentation of data collection practices, research questions, analysis methods, assumptions, stakeholders, funders, etc. 
2. Conducting reproducible research experiments
3. Peer reviewed research
4. Regular audits
5. Correct framing of the research[1] questions[2]
6. Curating a representative sample - Exploratory data analyis will help in assessing if a sample is representative enough.

# Data Analysis Methodologies

## What to use when

.card[
It can be hard to know which methodology to use when designing a data project. The most important thing for the success of your selection (and equity) is to make sure that your chosen methodology matches the kinds of research questions you have.

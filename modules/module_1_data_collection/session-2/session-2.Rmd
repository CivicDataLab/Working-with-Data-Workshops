# Session 1 - Recap

What we discussed
--

- Data Collection - How to (Primary vs Secondary)
- Collecting data from secondary sources
- The data biography (A must when using data from secondary data sources)
- Structured vs Unstructured data sources (Limited but easy to analyse vs Vast but hard to work with)

---

# Session 1 - Recap

- Collecting (structured) data from secondary sources
- Working with CSV files (Quite prone to certain data collection errors)
- Extracting data from PDF files (Working with Tabula)
- Collecting data from the web (Ethical web scraping)
- Using google sheets to scrape data from web pages

# Public data is messy

[Here](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide) is a guide that will help you in dealing with a few common problems that we associate with datasets.



> Most of these problems can be solved. Some of them can’t be solved and that means you should not use the data. Others can’t be solved, but with precautions you can continue using the data. In order to allow for these ambiguities, this guide is organized by who is best equipped to solve the problem: you, your source, an expert, etc. In the description of each problem you may also find suggestions for what to do if that person can’t help you. <sup>1</sup>

# Data collection use-cases

---

# Supreme Court Judge Profiles

Website - [https://main.sci.gov.in/chief-justice-judges](https://main.sci.gov.in/chief-justice-judges)

Requirement - Get judge profile details in a structured format

Challenges:

1. Direct download not available
2. Judge profile hidden behind a link
3. Current and Former judges are on different tabs but on the same URL

---

# Data scraping Alternatives

1. Crowd sourced data collection _More work for humans_
2. Training bots using AI _Challenge with implementation and accuracy of information_
3. Creating data standards _More work for data publishers_

> If your goal is to build something that’s going to be collecting data for a long time, like a government monitoring tool, think about how to identify, rally around, and target common standards. There’s some momentum for building shared code on top of shared data, and we’re starting to see real success stories. And so my closing message is to think long-term about how you collect the data; don’t plan on scraping forever. <sup>1</sup>

# Open data standards - What

> An open data standard is a set of specifications (or requirements) for how some sets of data should be made publicly available. <sup>1</sup>

.footnote[

---

# Open data standards - Why

- Scraping is unsustainable
- Machine-readable data is not enough
- To standardise data collection across time and space - - _A shared language_ that allows error free data exchange
- For generating more interoperable datasets
- Opportunity for a dialogue between consumers and producers of datasets

_International open government data specifications_

Specification - [https://www.popoloproject.com/](https://www.popoloproject.com/)

- For storing data related to elected officials
- Platforms like [EveryPolitician](https://everypolitician.org/) that have data for elected officials from 233 countries use the format for storing info
- OpenAustralia developed [TheyVoteforyou](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/), a legislative vote tracking tool, to import Popolo data

# The Tyranny of Spreadsheets

Nearly 16,000 positive Covid cases had disappeared completely from the UK’s contact tracing system. Why had the cases disappeared? Apparently, **Microsoft Excel had run out of numbers.**

> It was an astonishing story that would, in time, lead me to delve into the history of accountancy, epidemiology and vaccination, discuss file formatting with Microsoft’s founder, Bill Gates, and even trace the aftershocks of the collapse of Enron. But above all, it was a story that would teach me about the way we take numbers for granted.

# Exercise - Web Scraping + Data Exploration

- [Link](https://nalsa.gov.in/dashboard/) to NALSA dashboard
- Create a CSV file with variables available under the Victim Compensation Schemes table for these states: 
    - Delhi
    - Maharashtra
    - Karnataka
    - West Bengal
    - Uttar Pradesh
- Create a chart to compare the yearly compensation numbers between these states
- Create a folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1W1t0j1NETZDQ5F7j7Ts6tDNiMQUTKGXD) and upload the dataset (including the chart)

# Working with databases

---

# Why to use a database ?

- Dealing with large datasets

- Platform agnostic

- Programming language agnostic

- Easy to share and maintain as compared to storing data as multiple data files

---

# A relational database

- Data stored as tables

- Each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key (Primary Key). 

- The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute.

- Uses [SQL (Structured Query Language)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) to query ( _storing_, _manipulating_, _retrieving_) data

---

# Database terminologies

1.  **Schema** - _A database schema is the design of tables, columns, relations, and constraints that make up a logically distinct section of a database_. 
2. **Key** - _A key is a database field whose purpose is to uniquely identify a record_. Type off keys:
    - **Candidate Key** - _The set of columns that can each uniquely identify a record and from which the primary key is chosen._
    - **Primary Key** - _This key uniquely identifies a record in a table. It cannot be null.There can be only one Primary key in a table._
    - **Foreign Key** - _The key linking a record to a record in another table. A table's foreign key must exist as the primary key of another table._
4. **SQL** - _Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the most commonly used language to access data from a database_

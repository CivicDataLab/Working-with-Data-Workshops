# Exercise - Exploring data from eCourts

**Dataset** - [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hkcde3z2l1h9mq1/AADRe-BuBQ92ozAJiG7YERdCa?dl=0) - _The database contains 81.2 million cases_

**Source**: [Devdatalab](http://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-data)

**Objective**:

- Understand how the data is structured
- Import the data in a database
- Explore the sample datasets
- Find out the total cases present for each district for the year 2018

# Working with SQL JOINS

# JOINing Tables

.bg-washed-red.b--dark-red.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
A JOIN command is used where we need to query data that is spread across multiple tables
]

<br>

> Merging two data sets using SQL or SQL tools can be accomplished through JOINS. **A JOIN is a SQL instruction in the FROM clause** of your query that is used to identify the tables you are querying and how they should be combined.<sup>1</sup>

## EXERCISE - CASE WHEN & Subqueries

- Load [Mortaliy data](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/Working-with-Data-Workshops/blob/master/modules/module_2_data_exploration/data/mortality_data.csv) in the database
- Create a column to tag months where the total number of deaths was above or below average for the state of Rajasthan.
- The column can have only two values _Above average_ and _Below average_
- Sort the result dataset by year

--

.center[
.card[
```sql
select month, year, deaths, 
CASE WHEN 
	deaths < (select avg(deaths) as avg_deaths_RJ from mortality_data where state='Rajasthan') 
	THEN "belowAvg"

.card[
```sql
SELECT distinct state 
FROM mortality_data 
WHERE state LIKE '%Pradesh';

```
]

# REGEX Exercise

1. Import [NCRB data]() as a table
2. Find all crime heads related to `children` [can contain `child` or `children`]
3. Find all crime heads that mention `Murder`
4. Find all crime heads that start with `Murder`
5. Find all crime heads that are either `SLL` or `IPC` [ _REGEXP_ / _UNION_ ]

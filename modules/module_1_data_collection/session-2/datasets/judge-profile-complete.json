THAKKER AS AUTHOR\n\n    Justice Thakker is also an author. His Lordship has written several law books which have been appreciated in India, U.K. and U.S.A. His Lordship's \"Lectures on Administrative Law\" (Students' Edition) has been prescribed as a text book by various Universities at LL.B. and LL.M. level. Justice Thakker's \"Civil Procedure\" (Students' Edition) was warmly welcomed and highly appreciated by students, lawyers, law professors and scholars. Reviews of the book appeared in India, England and U.S.A.\n\n    Justice Thakker's \"Administrative Law\" (Lawyers' Edition) was foreworded by Hon'ble Mr. Justice M. Hidayatullah, former Chief Justice of India. His Lordship in the foreword stated: \"To write a book on administrative law as enforced in India is a very elaborate task but this has been performed by the author with great insight, industry and understanding. He has avoided pointing out the overstepping of the Constitution by the Supreme Court lawyers and Judges. I wish in India there was the lead of Lord Mansfield, Atkin, and Ried and most of Judges who wish to shine and who even depend upon the articles written by lawyers and professors, would learn from these Judges\". He further stated; \"All in all this is an excellent book, exhaustive and compelling and it will be a useful adjunct to the books on the subject written by English and American writers.\"\n\n    In Interchapter, Hon'ble Mr. Justice P.D. Desai, the then Chief Justice, High Court of Judicature at Bombay described the book as \"noteworthy for its treatment of the case law\". He said, \"A wide range is covered with the relevant English and American decisions also being referred. On each topic, all relevant decisions of Indian Courts, whether of the pre or post-independent era, have been digested and discussed. %uFFFD The author has not flinched from the expression of his candid views while discussing such decisions or offering criticism as regards views of the majority or minority, as the case may be, in different cases.\" Justice Desai concluded; \"It has given me immense pleasure to have been invited to be associated with an outstanding and lasting contribution of a brother Judge which is sure to aid the growth and development of Administrative Law.\"\n\n    The work was appreciated by Sir William Wade as also by Lord Denning. According to Sir William Wade, it is \"thorough and scholarly\". He found the book \"most useful\". In the words of Lord Denning, the book is \"an excellent piece of work, both in analysis and research\". Lord Denning proceeded to state, \"Your contribution for India rivals that of Sir William Wade\". His Lordship finally stated; \"I am keeping it in a foremost place in my library because, even at my age of 93, I still consider many points of administrative law and I look forward to finding much help from your book.\"\n\n    The Right Honourable Lord Templeman stated; \"I marvel at your being able to find the time to produce a book which covers a very difficult subject in extremely great detail. We were rather late in this country in taking up administrative law and though we have forged ahead we are still very glad to be referred to authorities from India and the United States.\"\n\n    Justice Thakker has revised \"Law of Writs\" by V.G. Ramachandran. The revised edition was dedicated to Lord Denning after approval from Lord Denning. The book was foreworded by a great Jurist, Hon'ble Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, the then Chief Justice of India. His Lordship stated; \"I am impressed by the comprehensive treatment of the main areas and sensitive touch on the grey areas\". His Lordship also stated; \"It is greatly satisfying to find that with all the preoccupations and responsibilities of the judicial office, Justice Thakker could spare time for such dedicated intellectual pursuits. This edition of Ramachandran's 'Law of Writs' has the imprint of the dedication of a fine man of law. I venture to hope that lawyers %uFFFD both as advocates and Judges %uFFFD benefit by Justice Thakker's refreshing scholarship.\"\n\n    In reply-letter, Lord Denning stated; \"I greatly appreciate your dedication of this volume to me and I regard it as a great honour that you should do so. I have been reading some of it already and I greatly admire all the work you have done in brining it up to date. %uFFFD You have done a magnificent work in bringing all this knowledge up to date and I am confident that it will be of the greatest use to all the Judges and lawyers of the great country of India, where the rule of law is still well maintained. I am keeping your volume by me and will refer to it whenever a question arises on these important matters. Through your book you have done much to preserve the rule of law and the doing of justice throughout the subcontinent of India.\"\n\n    Justice Thakker has written \"Code of Civil Procedure, 1908\" (Lawyers' Edition). The said work is a treatise on the Code of Civil Procedure and it will be in five volumes. Two volumes containing substantive law (Sections 1 to 158) have already been published. The book is foreworded by Hon'ble Dr. Justice A.S. Anand, the then Chief Justice of India. In the foreword, he stated; \"I can safely say that the present work on Code of Civil Procedure leaves nothing unexplained, which ought to have been explained. I am very impressed by the scholarly work of Justice Thakker.\"\n\n    Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.B. Majmudar of the Supreme Court in \"Introduction\" observed; \"The method adopted by the author in categorizing these topics by way of synopsis is very exhaustive and appropriate. At a glance such synopsis would give desired insight into the various nuances of sections concerned. To say the least, the aforesaid work of the learned author will go a long way in enabling all those concerned with trials in civil courts to effectively discharge their obligations towards the litigating public earlier at the Bar or on the Bench\".\n\n    Justice Thakker has also revised well-known work of \"Law of Crimes\" by Ratanlal and Dhirajlal, the Silver Jubilee Edition and Centenary Publication. The revised edition was dedicated to the sacred memory of Lord Macaulay, Founding Father of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n    In \"A Humble Foreword to a Classic's Centennial\", Hon'ble Mr. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer (Retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India) stated; \"A great book, like a celebrated scholar, deservedly commands admiration and good readership. And when the work is a classic and its centenary is sanctified by a silver edition authored by a judicial scholar, mere verbal encomium may not be adequate need. My pen does no exaggeration when I project Justice C.K. Thakker as a profound jurist, a scholarly Judge and an author the Denning mould, rare among the many the Bench wrapped in 'Lordly' robes\".\n\n    His Lordship also stated, \"Justice Thakker is a lovely contrast, a sound scholar, free from the symptoms of what Lord Hailsham called 'judges disease'. Fine man, versatile jurist, humility on the bench, Justice Thakker's ability is notable. His revised edition of Ratanlal is a rich addition to Indian legal literature, like his other books under other titles.

After obtaining his bachelor degree in Science from Ranchi University, he pursued his Degree in Law and obtained degree with 1st Class Distinction (Gold Medalist) in the year 1974, which was a rare phenomenon in those days.\n\n        He started practice in the year 1975 in Civil Court and specialized in civil side. By virtue of his resourceful skills and unique talent, he was named standing counsel for almost all the banks, insurance companies and financial institutions.\n\n        He shifted his practice to Ranchi Bench of Patna High Court in the year 1988. He was appointed as a Government Pleader in the year 1990, and was later appointed as Government Advocate in Ranchi Bench of Patna High Court in the year 1993. In a short span of time, he rose to top ranks. Almost all Institutions appointed him as their standing counsel including Universities, Electricity Board, Housing Board.\n\n        His profound knowledge of law and unfaltering courage, led to his elevation to the Bench and he became Judge of Patna High Court on 9th May, 1996 and on 15th November, 2000 he became a Judge of the Jharkand High Court.\n\n        In 2003, he was nominated by the Hon%uFFFDble Chief Justice of India as one of the members of Ravi and Beas Water Tribunal (Water Dispute between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan).

    "judge-profile-text": "Hon'ble Thiru. Justice Fakkir Mohamed Ibrahim Kalifulla.\n\n        The learned Judge is the son of Late Thiru. Justice M. Fakkir Mohamed and was born on 23.07.1951. He hails from Karaikudi, Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu and was enrolled as an Advocate on 20.08.1975. He was an active Labour Law Practitioner as Partner of the Lawyer's Firm called M/s. T.S. Gopalan & Co., and appeared for various Public and Private Sector Undertakings, Nationalised and Scheduled Banks. He was the Standing Counsel for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. On 02.03.2000, His Lordship was appointed as Permanent Judge of the Madras High Court.\n\n        After assumption of office, the learned Judge has rendered very many landmark Judgments. In one case relating to election to a local body, namely, the Chennai City Corporation, sitting in a Division Bench, the learned Judge rendered a dissenting Judgment holding that the election in respect of 99 wards was liable to be set aside. The matter was referred to a third Judge and the third Judge also confirmed the view of Justice F.M.Ibrahim Kalifulla.\n        Enthralled by the verdict of the learned Judge, there was widespread appreciation from all quarters. To quote a few, there was an article written by a retired conscientious bureaucrat of the Indian Administrative Service, which would be of worth mentioning. The said article appeared in %uFFFDNEWS TODAY%uFFFD dated 13.1.2007 under the caption %uFFFD A MOMENT OF INFAMY FOR TAMILNADU GOVERNMENT%uFFFD. It will be appropriate to quote what the author said in his article.\n\n            %uFFFDThrough his judgment, Mr. Justice Kalifulla has given cubic content to the immortal words of Justice Felix Frankfurter: %uFFFDJudges are not merely the habitations of bloodless categories of the law which pursue their pre-destined ends%uFFFD. Instead of taking a sterile, bloodless and neutrally neutral view between good and evil, he has categorically declared:%uFFFD He has referred to the word of caution given by the Supreme Court of India to the effect that successful candidates who had resorted to foul methods should not be allowed to reap the benefits. He has also stated that he was convinced that %uFFFDthere was an extreme and extraordinary situation%uFFFD, which warranted an extraordinary remedy in view of the magnitude of the situation. He has concluded that it would be wholly inappropriate if fresh elections were not ordered to a majority of the wards. By his verdict setting aside the civic elections in 99 wards out of 155 wards, Mr. Justice Kalifulla has demonstrated that another great American Judge and Jurist Benjamin N Cardozo (1870-1938) was absolutely right when he stated: %uFFFDThe great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men, do not turn aside in their course, and pass the judges by%uFFFD.\n\n        Appreciating the uncompromised stand taken by the learned Judge on the Corporation Polls, the Editor of the Madras Law Journal has expressed his view in the following words, which is reported in (2007) 1 MLJ Page 1, which read as under:\n\n            %uFFFDWhatever be the ultimate majority opinion that might emerge, it fills us with pride that a judge obtains a special eulogical mention in the Press for what it perceives to be correct decision. Praiseful references are made in obituary columns of farewell occasions. %uFFFDWhen they come, when the judge is still in the Bench, not merely from a lawyer, who may have an axe to grind, but from the press, it is a defining moment for the judiciary itself.%uFFFD\n\n        One other landmark judgment delivered by the learned Judge was relating to introduction of Vedic Astrology as a course of Scientific study in the Indian Universities which had the seal of approval of the Supreme Court. When a challenge was made in the High Court in a writ petition, the learned Judge declined to interfere with the move of the State. In the Judgment reported in 2004-4-L.W.195 (Dr.K.Natarajan, Director, Dr.K.N..Study Centre for Humanism V. The Union of India represented by its Secretary to the Human Resources Department, New Delhi and another), the learned Judge expressed his views in the following words:\n\n            %uFFFD%uFFFD..The very purpose of imparting education is to gain knowledge and also education is stated to be the teacher of a teacher. Therefore, there should be every scope for making a study on very many subjects in order to enrich one%uFFFDs craving for knowledge. Any such attempt from any quarters in furtherance of that pursuit, in my opinion should not, therefore, be stultified. %uFFFD%uFFFDBy introducing the subject of Vedic Astrology either as a science subject or as an arts subject or under any other category, it will have to held that the same would only help the pupil to gain knowledge in that particular subject. %uFFFD%uFFFDWhen it is for the pupil concerned to select any particular field or subject in furtherance of his future career, merely because the subject has got its basic origin traceable to some cult, it cannot be held that the same would only result in propagation of a particular religion. On that footing, it cannot be held that there should be a ban on introduction of that subject as a course of scientific study.%uFFFD\n\n        The said view of the learned Judge was approved by the Hon%uFFFDble Supreme Court when a similar challenge came up for consideration before the Hon%uFFFDble Supreme Court. It is also reported in 2004-4 L.W.197. While approving the view of the Learned Judge, the Hon%uFFFDble Supreme Court referred in detail the point of view expressed by the Learned Judge in paragraph 16 of the judgment.\n        Transferred to High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and assumed charge of Office on 24.02.2011.\n        Appointed as Acting Chief Justice of High Court of Jammu and Kashmir on 07.04.2011.\n\n        Took oath as Chief Justice of High Court of Jammu and Kashmir on 18.09.2011.\n        Elevated as Judge, Supreme Court of India on 2nd April, 2012. \n        Retired on 22nd July, 2016.",

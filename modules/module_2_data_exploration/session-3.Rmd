## Exercise - Exploring data from eCourts

**Dataset** - [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hkcde3z2l1h9mq1/AADRe-BuBQ92ozAJiG7YERdCa?dl=0) - _The database contains 81.2 million cases_

**Source**: [Devdatalab](http://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-data)

**Objective**:

- Understand how the data is structured
- Import the data in a database
- Explore the sample datasets
- Find out the total cases present for each district for the year 2018

**Tags**

SELECT 
	state_code, dist_code, count(*) AS total_cases 
FROM 
	cases_2018 
GROUP BY state_code, dist_code
```
]

## Exercise - Using Databases

- Install SQLite DB Browser
- Create a new database
- Load the judges_clean dataset in the DB
- Find the distribution of male/female judges in **Bengaluru** district court where judge position is _chief metropolitan magistrate_
- Save the file, as CSV, in the drive

--

.center[
.card[
```sql
SELECT 
	judge_position, female_judge, count(*) as total_judges
FROM 
	judges_clean
WHERE 
	state_code = 3 AND dist_code = 20 AND judge_position = 'chief metropolitan magistrate'
GROUP BY 
	judge_position, female_judge
```
]
]

# Working with Dates

Find the average duration of male and female judges appointed as `chief metropolitan magistrate` in the district courts of `BENGALURU`

.center[
.card[
```sql
SELECT 
	judge_position, female_judge, count(*) AS total_judges, 
	avg(
		julianday(substr(end_date,7,4) || '-' ||  substr(end_date,4,2) || '-' || substr(end_date,1,2)) - 
		julianday(substr(start_date,7,4) || '-' ||  substr(start_date,4,2) || '-' || substr(start_date,1,2))
		) as avg_judge_duration 
FROM judges_clean 
WHERE 
	state_code = 3 AND 
	dist_code = 20 AND 
	judge_position = 'chief metropolitan magistrate' 
	AND female_judge LIKE '%female%'
GROUP BY 
	judge_position, female_judge

# JOINing Tables

.bg-washed-red.b--dark-red.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
A JOIN command is used where we need to query data that is spread across multiple tables
]

<br>

> Merging two data sets using SQL or SQL tools can be accomplished through JOINS. **A JOIN is a SQL instruction in the FROM clause** of your query that is used to identify the tables you are querying and how they should be combined.<sup>1</sup>

## JOINS - Exercise 1

- Create a table that only contains cases registered with the Karnataka district courts
- Join the above table with `cases_district_key` to get district name
- Find the total number of cases in each district. Arrange the results in descending order
- Use a subquery to combine the two queries in one

--

.center[
.card[
```sql
SELECT a2.district_name, count(*) AS total_cases 
FROM (SELECT 
	a.*, b.district_name 
FROM 
	cases_2018_karnataka AS a 
LEFT JOIN
	cases_district_key AS b
ON a.state_code = b.state_code AND a.dist_code = b.dist_code) AS a2 
GROUP BY a2.district_name 
ORDER BY total_cases DESC
```

## EXERCISE - CASE WHEN & Subqueries

- Load [Mortality data](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/Working-with-Data-Workshops/blob/master/modules/module_2_data_exploration/data/mortality_data.csv) in the database
- Create a column to tag months where the total number of deaths was above or below average for the state of Rajasthan.
- The column can have only two values _Above average_ and _Below average_
- Sort the result dataset by year

--

.center[
.card[
```sql
select month, year, deaths, 
CASE WHEN 
	deaths < (select avg(deaths) as avg_deaths_RJ from mortality_data where state='Rajasthan') 
	THEN "belowAvg" 
	ELSE "aboveAvg" 
	END as "trends" 
FROM mortality_data where state='Rajasthan' order by year desc;

1. Import [NCRB data](https://github.com/CivicDataLab/Working-with-Data-Workshops/blob/master/modules/module_2_data_exploration/data/ncrb.csv)
